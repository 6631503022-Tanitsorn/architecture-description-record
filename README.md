# Title
Decision to Use MongoDB Replication for High Availability

## Context
Our application requires high availability and fault tolerance to ensure minimal downtime. A single database instance creates a single point of failure, which is unacceptable for our use case. We need a mechanism that ensures automatic failover and data redundancy to maintain system reliability.

## Decision
We have decided to implement MongoDB Replica Sets to enhance availability. A Replica Set consists of:
- Primary Node: Handles all write operations.
- Secondary Nodes: Replicate data asynchronously from the Primary.
- Automatic Failover: If the Primary Node fails, a new Primary is elected automatically.
- Read Load Balancing: Read operations can be distributed across secondary nodes.
- Data Redundancy & Disaster Recovery: Automatic backups through replication ensure data safety.

## Rationale
We choose MongoDB replication because it provides a robust solution for ensuring high availability, fault tolerance, and data redundancy. A single-node database creates a significant risk of downtime in case of failure. With a replica set, we achieve automatic failover, allowing uninterrupted service even if a node fails. Additionally, replication improves read performance by distributing read operations across secondary nodes.

## Consequences
Pros:
- High availability with automatic failover.
- Load balancing across multiple nodes improves read performance.
- Data redundancy ensures disaster recovery.

Cons:
- Increased infrastructure costs due to multiple nodes.
- Replication lag can cause slight inconsistencies in real-time applications.
- Network overhead due to continuous data synchronization.

## Sample code
1) Start MongoDB Instances
```sh
mongod --replSet myReplicaSet --port 27017 --dbpath /data/node1 --bind_ip localhost &
mongod --replSet myReplicaSet --port 27018 --dbpath /data/node2 --bind_ip localhost &
mongod --replSet myReplicaSet --port 27019 --dbpath /data/node3 --bind_ip localhost &
```
2) Initialize the Replica Set
```sh
mongo --port 27017
```
```js
rs.initiate(
  {
    _id: "myReplicaSet",
    members: [
      { _id: 0, host: "localhost:27017" },
      { _id: 1, host: "localhost:27018" },
      { _id: 2, host: "localhost:27019" }
    ]
  }
);
```
3) Check Replica Set Status
```js
rs.status();
```
4) Set Read Preference for Load Balancing
```js
db.getMongo().setReadPref("secondaryPreferred");
```
5) Application Connection to Replica Set
```java
MongoClient mongoClient = new MongoClient(
    new MongoClientURI("mongodb://localhost:27017,localhost:27018,localhost:27019/?replicaSet=myReplicaSet")
);
MongoDatabase database = mongoClient.getDatabase("myDB");
```
6) Monitor Replica Set
```sh
mongostat --host localhost:27017
```
